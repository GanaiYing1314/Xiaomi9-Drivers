- #### Note : This description is for reference only. It does not represent any commitment to develop Windows on XIAOMI 9 in any way, nor does it mean that all functions will be available or development will be completed forever. You should not buy this device for the purpose of using Windows on it, and hope that it will have complete functions in the end. The functions available today should be considered as the most you can get.We should take this into consideration when purchasing. Don't think we will make everything normal.
